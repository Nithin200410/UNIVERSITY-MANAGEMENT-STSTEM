                        Dear All,
    
                        Do you feel you don't have much to offer?<br><br>
    
                        You have the most precious resource of all: the ability to save a life by donating blood! Help share this invaluable gift with someone in need.  Rarely do we get a chance to serve the society especially if it is a matter of saving some one's life.<br><br>
    
                        Luckily in December 2022 each one of us is getting a chance to save three lives.  A Voluntary blood donation camp is being organized by Inner Wheel Club, Sri Ram Hospital Jalandhar &  “LPUNSS units Aahavan | Sankalp ”, an initiative of Department of Community Services, Division of Youth Affairs, Student Welfare Wing, LPU.<br><br>
    
                        Do you know that,<br><br>
    
                        * Every 3 out of 10 people in India need blood.<br><br>
    
                        * 75% of the voluntary donors in our country donate only once per year.<br><br>
    
                        * This shortage can be overcome if just 2% of our country's youth donate blood.<br><br>
